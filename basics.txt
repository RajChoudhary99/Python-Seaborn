Why Seaborn?

1) provides a layer of abstraction hence simpler to use
2) better aesthetics
3) more graphs included

Seaborn Roadmap -

1) Types of Functions

Figure Level(figure is the blank white space where the graph is located)
Axis Level(axis is the plot which is inside the blank space)

note - figure level comes in top of heirarchy , then comes axis level

2) Main Classification

Relational Plot(scatterplot , line plot, Relplot - it is used for making axes level plots in figure level plots, why? because through figure level plots many axes level plots can be made
)
Distribution Plot(histogram, kdeplot, rugplot, displot - figure to axes level)
Categorical Plot(barplot, countplot, boxplot, violinplot)
Regression Plot
Matrix Plot(heatmap, clustermap)
Multiplots(jointplot, pairplot)
